                            with the five other European Institutions listed below, began in 2021 and will ran for
                            two years.

                            the impact of Covid-19 on higher education teaching, and to explore new possibilities for
                            pedagogy and digital innovation.

                            This research project aimed to explore how technology can be used to enhance the educational
                            experience and pedagogy of lessons in the classroom. The project evaluated various
                            user-friendly technologies and assessed their potential benefits and drawbacks, considering
                            factors such as student engagement and learning outcomes. Following the completion of the
                            research, some of the key findings were incorporated into a multi-million-pound development
                            project for a new campus, creating a more modern and efficient learning environment for
                            students and staff.

                            MediaWall, spanning two storeys of the atrium at Bath Spa University, it has successfully
                            hosted more than 50 projects from international artists and researchers over the course of
                            five years. Through these projects, MediaWall has created a space that encourages the
                            process of learning through creation, effectively erasing the boundaries between bodies and
                            space, as well as between movement and dimensionality.
                            <br><br>
                            Composed of 30 HD display panels arranged in a 3x10 grid, MediaWall measures 7.35 meters in
                            height and 3.75 meters in width.

                            designers of Monument Valley, and Bruce Munro. My role was to create large visual
                            reproductions of their work in various formats for this impressive video wall.
