                            This research project aimed to explore how technology can be used to enhance the educational
                            experience and pedagogy of lessons in the classroom. The project evaluated various
                            user-friendly technologies and assessed their potential benefits and drawbacks, considering
                            factors such as student engagement and learning outcomes. Following the completion of the
                            research, some of the key findings were incorporated into a multi-million-pound development
                            project for a new campus, creating a more modern and efficient learning environment for
                            students and staff.

                            MediaWall, spanning two storeys of the atrium at Bath Spa University, it has successfully
                            hosted more than 50 projects from international artists and researchers over the course of
                            five years. Through these projects, MediaWall has created a space that encourages the
                            process of learning through creation, effectively erasing the boundaries between bodies and
                            space, as well as between movement and dimensionality.

                            Composed of 30 HD display panels arranged in a 3x10 grid, MediaWall measures 7.35 meters in
                            height and 3.75 meters in width.

                            2015. The festival featured a diverse range of works, including films, sculptures, and
                            immersive pieces that incorporated light and projection. Notably, many of the participating
                            artists and contributors were students and staff members from Bath Spa School of Art and
                            Design.

                            Bathspa had the opportunity to showcase the work of the renowned Chinese artist, Cao Fei,
                            for a two-week exhibition. The centerpiece of the exhibition was a surreal projection house
                            featuring a giant inflatable suckling pig, which explored themes of prosperity and
                            abundance. The work had previously been exhibited in prestigious venues around the world,
                            including the Serpentine Gallary in London, MoMA in New York, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris,
                            and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The exhibition allowed the local community to engage

                            This project, which was launched in collaboration between the Fine Art schools of Bath
                            School of Art & Design and Norwich University of the Arts, aims to delve into the art world
                            by conducting interviews with renowned sculptor Caro and his studio assistants. It also
                            involves group discussions with artists and students, and features contributions from art
                            critics and writers of Fine Art and Education. Its goal is to explore different aspects of
                            artists' careers, their methods of creating art, and the communities they belong to.

                            My role was to document parts of the project that took place at Bath School of Art & Design
                            through photography, video and sound recording of interviews, and to edit the footage for
                            the research project.
