                            <br>
                            At the end of each academic year, the final year students at Bath Spa University put on an
                            end-of-year show, which represents the culmination of their studies over the past three
                            years. As a technican I support this event, my role is quite varied, and I may be called
                            upon to
                            assist with a variety of tasks, including working within my area of specialist support, as
                            well as doing more general tasks like painting walls and hanging artwork. However, the main
                            focus of my support is typically centered around AV equipment, printing, mounting of prints,
                            and creating projection spaces. By helping to ensure that the necessary equipment and
                            facilities are in place, I aim to facilitate a successful and memorable end-of-year show
                            that truly showcases the hard work and dedication of these talented students.

                            As a workshop technican for moving image at Bath Spa University, I am responsible for
                            helping students with a wide range of tasks related to productions, from editing films
                            shot on phones to working with 4K film footage and animation. One of the key aspects of my
                            role is assessing the skill level of each individual student and adapting quickly to their
                            needs, providing demonstrations that are tailored to their particular abilities. By
                            providing this personalized support, I strive to help each student reach their full
                            potential and succeed in their artistic endeavors.

                        <p>
                            <br>
                            Every year, Bath Spa University offers the Porthleven prize to twenty students, giving them
                            the opportunity to participate in a five-day residency with workshops.
                            From these twenty students, ten will be selected to undergo a fully-funded twelve-day
                            residency at the Porthleven Lifeboat Art Studio. As a technician for the university's
                            students, I have helped by providing assistance in the form of equipment and setup for their
                            final residency shows. In most cases, this has involved setting up projection equipment, but
                            the extent of my involvement has varied depending on the needs of the prize winners. By
                            helping to create an environment in which these students can showcase their talents, I am
                            proud to contribute to the success of these up-and-coming artists.

                            Phoebe, a ceramic artist and dancer, explored the decomposition of unfired ceramic pots for
                            her final Master of Art piece. Her work was displayed in the Holburne Museum in Bath,
                            showcasing her unique and innovative approach to ceramic art. In order to support Phoebe's
                            artistic vision, I provided assistance in a number of ways. Firstly, I helped to set up
                            lighting and video equipment in the lighting studios, ensuring that her work was presented
                            in the best possible light. Additionally, I provided support in editing her final piece,
                            helping her to refine and perfect her vision. Finally, I assisted in setting up the
                            projection and sound equipment for her final year show, allowing her to fully showcase her
                            work to a wider audience.

                            created across multiple disciplines. The final cut of the project was shortlisted for the
                            Visions of Science ArtPrize at The Edge in 2020 and long-listed for UK New Artist in 2022.
                            The project has been screened at several venues, including Centre of Gravity in Bristol in
                            2020 and Wiltshire Creative at Salisbury Playhouse in 2021. Despite the challenges posed by
                            the COVID-19 pandemic, I assisted Alyson by providing support in editing the video footage
                            into the final piece. Additionally, I helped with the setup of projection and sound

                        <h5>year 2016</h5>
                        <p>
                            <br>
                            During his time at Bath Spa University, Ben delved into photography as a fine art medium and
                            created a final piece that focused on scale and photos of the moon's surface. To support his
                            studies, I aided in the production of his final year project by producing large prints of
                            his work, which were dry mounted onto aluminum backing boards and hung in a gallery space.
                            By showcasing his work in this manner, Ben was able to fully express his vision and
                            demonstrate the potential of photography as a fine art medium.
